# Chapter 1: Building Blocks

---
### Objectives:
- Handling date, time, text, numeric, and boolean values
  - Use primitive and wrapper classes including Math API, parentheses, type promotion, and
  casting to evaluate arithmetic and boolean expressions
- Utilizing Java Object-Oriented Approach
  - Declare and instantiate Java Objects, and explain the object life-cycle including 
  creation, reassigning references, and garbage collection
  - Understand variable scopes, use local variable type inference, apply encapsulation, 
  and make objects immutable

---
### Notes:
- JDK (Java Development Kit) contain the minimum software you need to do Java Development
  - Key Commands: 
    - javac: _Converts_ **.java** _source file into_ **.class** _bytecode_
    - java: _Launches JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and executes the program_
    - jar: _Packages file together_
    - javadoc: _Generates documentation_
  - Released every 6 months on the Oracle's website or download from OpenJDK
- JRE (Java Runtime Environment) was a subset of the JDK that was used for running a program
but could not compile one. (Used in Java 8 and earlier)
- API (Application Programming Interface)
- IDE (Integrated Development Environment) used to make writing and running code easier
- Java classes have 2 primary elements (or members of the class): Fields & Methods 


---
### Key Words:
- **Classes**: _the basic building blocks with defined parts and characteristics_
- **Object**: _runtime instance of a class in memory; often reffered to as an instance of 
a class in memory_
- **Reference**: _a variable that points to an object_
- **Field** (variable): _holds the state of the program_
- **Method** (function or procedure): _operate on the state_

### Questions:
- How does the JVM run the bytecode on any machine?
- How to go about identifying the correct API to use for a given situation?
